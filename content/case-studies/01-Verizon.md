I joined Verizon's Open Innovation Lab in 2016 after I graduated from Parsons School of Design. During my six month residency, I conducted extensive research on new product opportunities for chatbots. We worked in teams to develop functional prototypes within the constraints of the business. In the end, we pitched ideas to leadership from various parts of the company.

Following my experiences at Open Innovation Lab, I joined the Omni Customer Experience team. It focuses on managing customer experiences across all conversational interfaces for the brand. Verizon is a multi-faceted organization with a customer base of over 150 million customers. As a Lead Experience Manager on the Omni Customer Experience team, I ensure that we provide a delightful automated chat support experience to our customers while reducing their need to call in.

## 01. Product & Services

I manage chatbots that serve customers on Verizon branded mobile apps and websites, including conversation experiences, rolled out on social media channels, SMS, and business messages. Some notable things that the bot helps customers with are paying their bills, managing plans, searching and discovering new content, finding personalized viewing recommendations, troubleshoot technical issues, and even make purchases.

My principles when developing use-cases is:

- **"Customer first" strategy**  
We talk a lot about empathy in the chatbot world. It cannot be pretentious; moreover, it is easy to be bad at it. We have to be mindful of at what point in the user journey is the customer reaching out to us for support. What actions did the user take, and what key event occurred before this interaction? What 'might' they need immediately? If we understand that they are facing severe issues, it makes much more sense to hand off the chat to a live representative for white-glove service.

- **Provide consistent experience**  
Chat experiences across different channels should appear consistent, agnostic of the application. It not only avoids confusion but sets positive business expectations with the customers, no matter where they choose to interact with us.

- **Inclusive support and care**  
If we ever neglect even 1% of our users, offering them an inferior experience, that itself would result in thousands of frustrated loyal users. Hence at a scale this big, it is very critical to have an air-tight project plan that thoroughly covers all aspects of the use-case, including edge cases. Consult subject matter experts wherever necessary.

### Key Benefits to Business
Instead of dealing with the agony of 1-800 numbers, chatbots let customers connect with a business asynchronously. Following are some of the key benefits that chatbots provide: ^[Please note that the actual figures cannot be disclosed.]
- Improved automation rate for queries by customers.
- An overall reduction in call-volumes.
- Reduced chat-handle-time for chat agents.
- Increased [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) and [Customer Satisfaction Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction).
- Financial savings accrued from call-deflections.


## 02. My Role
I focus on driving Verizon's conversational commerce strategy for a unified chat and messaging experience across all customer-facing communication channels. I like to think of myself as a nexus between engineering and business units, overseeing inbound product development from inception to implementation. During my work at Verizon, I've led the implementation of chatbots on various applications supported by AI-driven use-cases. At Verizon, this demands proficiency in communication across disciplines, to effectively collaborate with dozens of organization units - business, engineering, design, product, marketing, legal, and IT security.

Continuously, I audit and ensure that the chatbot experiences are mindful and have a holistic context of customers' past interactions with Verizon. It is necessary to develop insights-driven application experiences that would manageably scale without conflicting with any prior implementation of business rules. I work closely with end to end enterprise architecture team to define specs for big projects that require significant back end integrations. I often provide my input to experience designers who create and document the library of conversation flows. I evaluate if the UI and UX designs are technically feasible before handing off the specs to engineering.

While creating conversation flows, we have to be mindful of striking the right tone of language at every customer touchpoint. The 'Goldilocks Zone' is where automated responses don't come across as impersonal and unemotional, and yet are not overly cheeky. The right communication tone from a brand catering to customers nationwide needs to be inclusive of all cultures and ages.

## 03. My Process

I enjoy managing the lifecycle of various chatbots available across branded mobile apps, websites, SMS, business messages, and so on. It starts with crafting the product and service roadmap based on business strategies. Then utilize Gantt charts to lay out short term and long term goals. It aids in uncovering dependencies and formulating realistic timelines. I usually deconstruct large items into smaller, manageable work and actionable tasks. With a plan in hand, it also is my responsibility that each individual involved is clear about their assignment. For working in big groups, we rely on a [responsibility assignment matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) for this purpose. I appreciate working with data science leads to uncovering insights. It helps the product-lead to assess or adjust the goals for the next release.

The lifecycle sequence for a chatbot feature or use-case is broadly similar to general digital services.
- **Prioritize**: Use indicators from customer behavior, feedback, and data analytics to inform business priorities.
- **Design**: Experience and system-architecture design that helps in shaping the desired customer experience.
- **Build**: Allocating tasks, tracking timelines, identifying blockers, and contingency planning.
- **Testing**: Progress through QA and UAT testing to weed out bugs and identify potential enhancements.
- **Launch**: Release plans and communication.
- **Measure**: Specs for tracking, reporting funnel, dashboards, data validation.
- **Iterate**: Retrospective, assessments, feedback, reflect on the roadmap, and back to prioritization.
