I am a technical product manager with experience in developing both hardware and software product development. Currently, I hold a Senior Product Manager position at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute), where I manage languages and ecosystems for the [serverless computing platform](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute).

Previously, I co-founded a [climate intelligence company](https://climasens.com/), managed chatbots and [conversational experiences](/article?name=projects%2F10-Verizon), developed [geospatial applications](/article?name=projects%2F11-Urban-Systems-Lab), created an [augmented collaboration](/article?name=projects%2F09-Stickie) tool, and built a CNC machine capable of [3D printing glass](/article?name=projects%2F07-Quartz) at extremely high temperatures ðŸ”¥
