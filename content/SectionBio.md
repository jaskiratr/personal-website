My work spans across multiple disciplines, teaming with organizations to build category defining products and working proof-of-concepts. I’m currently a Product Manager with Verizon’s Digital Innovation and Strategy team, and also serve as a Lead Technical Developer at Urban Systems Lab, The New School in New York.

It is my passion for technical product development that allows me to comfortably take up multi-faceted roles. I am able to bridge the gap between latest technological tools, and an organization's initiatives, expanding opportunities to new creative avenues worthy of exploration.

Over last decade, I've focused on building intelligent products infused with cutting edge artificial intelligence to build better user experiences. At Verizon, I manage the implementation of automating conversational support through bots. In short, chatbots. The infrastructure orchestrates broadly over 2 million of customer queries per month across multiple digital channels.
