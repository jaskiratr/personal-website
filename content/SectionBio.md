My work spans across various disciplines, supporting organizations to build category-defining products and prototypes. I am passionate about technical product development and enjoy performing multi-faceted roles. I love pursing challenging business problems, applying design thinking to explore new creative avenues worthy of investigation.

I'm currently a Lead Experience Manager at Verizon's Omni Customer Experience team, managing chatbot conversational experiences. These are embedded in numerous branded mobile and web experiences, infused with real-time insights to provide rich user experiences. 

I also work on product development, and strategy at Senscity, a climate intelligence company, co-founded in 2018. I lead the work on system architecture, product design, analytics to support business goals.
