My work spans various disciplines, supporting organizations to build category-defining products and services. I am passionate about technical product development and enjoy performing multi-faceted roles.

I'm currently a Senior Product Manager at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute), managing languages and ecosystems for the [serverless computing platform](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute).

In the past, I co-founded a [climate intelligence company](https://climasens.com/) for understanding climate risk; managed chatbots and [conversational experiences](/article?name=projects%2F10-Verizon); developed [geospatial data processing](/article?name=projects%2F11-Urban-Systems-Lab) pipelines; designed physical-digital [augmented collaboration](/article?name=projects%2F09-Stickie) tool; and constructed an extremely hot CNC machine for [3D printing glass](/article?name=projects%2F07-Quartz)ðŸ”¥
