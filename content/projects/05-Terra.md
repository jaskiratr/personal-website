Terra is a terrain mapping service that uses drones to 3D scan for constructing and inspecting power lines. Using PowerGrid India as an exemplary client, we are focusing to provide a service for engineers working on the construction & maintenance of transmission power lines.

> ### Currently, 125 miles a day for line data can be collected by using helicopters. The cost of that is roughly $300.00 USD per mile. 

Our user interviews suggested that the daily cost of using helicopters for transmission line maintenence is estimated to be around $37,500 USD. For a fraction of that cost, drones can be deployed in certain scenarios for local inspection within 5 mile radius per flight. It can greatly assist in providing accurate latest data in support of remote sensing technologies.

It is particularly useful in two scenarios. One, is during the scouting and assessment phase. Compared to conventional methods of aerial survey, tt can rapidly scan a terrain prior to construction of power transmission lines. 
Second, it can inspect the existing power transmission lines for fault and defects. Terra could inspect sag detection in transmission line conductors. Assess the conductor health and validate the necessary ground clearances as per standards. Identify visual defects in infrastructure assets.
