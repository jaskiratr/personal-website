The “Shape Changing Materials” workshop brought together smart materials with computational design and digital fabrication in context to garments or wearables. This 3-day workshop explored the possibilities of interactive wearable projects and finding alternative ways to use smart materials. The participants experimented with responsive shape-shifting materials through 3D modeling and computation-based approaches using Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.

Along with hands-on prototyping, starter-code was provided for participants and workshop guests to generate a digitally simulated materials. The final outcome was be prototypes of shape changing materials to discover garment behavior. Participants used user-centered methods to contextualize the use cases of an interactive garment solution.
